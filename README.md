# Markdown-Report-Example
An example of how to create a Markdown-based report for export to PDF. The editor of choice for this is [Obsidian Md](https://obsidian.md)


## Quick start guide
1. **Install Obsidian Md** from the [download webpage](https://obsidian.md/download). It is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. This quick start guide will assume you are using Linux. 
   I recommend installing either the .deb or .tar.gz, but there are flatpak and Snap store versions available too. There is currently no way to install using `apt`.
2. **Download this repository**. You can download it as a .zip file with the button above, or clone from the command line interface using
```md
https://github.com/Hans-Bananendans/Markdown-Report-Example.git
```
or
```md
gh repo clone Hans-Bananendans/Markdown-Report-Example
```
(this command requires the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to be installed)

3. Open Obsidian Md, open a vault and select the option *Open folder as vault*. Select the folder in which you cloned this repository as the vault location. If successful, you will see a list of the files in this repository appear in a column on the left-hand side.

4. With the free version of Obsidian Md, you can select any page, and export is as PDF. However, this is a bit buggy sometimes (some elements render oddly when using Obsidian Md in night mode, for example), and links do not work at all (neither internal nor external links).
