This paper presents the derivation of four different magnetic field equations:
 - Single circular loop
 - Circular Helmholtz coil
 - Single square loop
 - Square Helmholtz coil

It also derives the ideal coil spacing of a square Helmholtz coil pair; where for circular coil pairs, the ideal spacing is equal to the radius of the coils, for square coil pairs this is equal to 0.544505643 times the side length of the coil.
