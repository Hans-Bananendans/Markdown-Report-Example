## Design of a Helmholtz Coil For Susceptibility Testing using Variational Calculus and Experimental Verification
### Dr. Theodore Anderson

This paper describes a mathematical method (Lagrangian multipliers) to predict optimum Helmholtz coil designs. Using this method, they try to maximize the Helmholtz resonance frequency with constraints on:
 - magnetic flux density
 - the electric field 
 - current 
 - impedance
